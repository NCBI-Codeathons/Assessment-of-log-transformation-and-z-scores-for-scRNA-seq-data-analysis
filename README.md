## Problem
Numerous methods have been proposed for the normalization of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. Yet, these methods have not been thoroughly benchmarked and assessed, partly owing to the lack of a metric that appropriately measures the performancee of any normalization method. A critical step in the analysis pipeline that adjusts for unwanted biological and technical effects that can mask the signal of interest. 

## Proposed Solution and Methods
Here we benchmark the performance of eight commonly used scRNA-seq normalization methods, listed in the **Methods Tested** section, on various datasets. We use blah blah as a measure of normalization quality, based on the rationale that blah blah.

We will normalize the PBMC_10X_10K data using the methods listed in the **Methods Tested** section. Then, we will downsample the counts from the data to leave all cells with a pre‚Äêspecified number of counts or fewer. Downsampling can deliver a more realistic representation of what cellular expression profiles would look like at similar count depths. We will look at the correlation of highly variable genes and differentially expressed genes on various different data sets and compare them to median library size normalization. This gives us the set of differentially expressed genes.

We will perform various clustering techniques such as PhenoGraph, ---- clustering methods.
PhenoGraph is a clustering method designed for high-dimensional single-cell data. It works by creating a graph ("network") representing phenotypic similarities between cells and then identifying communities in this graph. The Number of nearest neighbours, default is set to 30.
